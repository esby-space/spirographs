# Chapter 3

## Around an Elliptal World

Be warned fellow traveller. In this chapter, we venture outside the world of the spirograph into that mysterious and frequently terrifying world of theory. First, we will explore a way of apporximating the path traced by a spirograph with an elliptical track. But in the next chapter, we will not only make this approximation exact, we can generalize our equations to make a spirograph with any track imaginable.
