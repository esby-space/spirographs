## Observations to Keep Us Spinning

I hope you had as much as we did playing around in Desmos with all of these equations! Here are some of our favorite things we noticed:

## Hypotrochoids

### A Perfect Pronged Shape

Setting $r$ (the radius of inner wheel) to $R/q$ (the radius of the track divided by some integrer), yields a $n$ pronged shape.

### A Pointed Image

Likewise, setting $r$ to $R/q$, where $q=\frac{a}{b}$ (with $a$ and $b$ being relatively prime numbers), then the resulting shape will have $a$ petals.

### Limacons-ish

Setting $r$ to $bR$ where $b$ is an integer, (notice how this will make $r > R$), the resulting shape is a limacon-like shape with $\frac{b-1}{2}$ layers.

## Epitrochoids

### Cardiods

Setting $r$ to $R$ forms a cardiod:

### Neproid

Setting $r$ to $\frac{R}{2}$ forms a neproid:

### Flowers

Similarly, setting $r$ to $qR$ where $q$ is an integer forms a flower with $q$ petals:

### Reversed Limacons

Setting $r$ to $\frac{R}{b}$ where $b$ is an integer yields something that looks like a reversed limacon:
