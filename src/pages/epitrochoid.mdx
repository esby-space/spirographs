# Chapter 2

## Drawing Outside the Lines

Now in many spirograph kits, the large track gears also have teeth on the outside. This means (given enough precision and patience), that we can move the rotating circle on the outside of the track! This will form an **epitrochoid**.

We could do what we did in the last chapter, setting up a new diagram and doing a lot of trigonometry. However, there's a simpler way of doing this.

Let's take a look at our final equation for a hypotrochoid:

$$
\begin{align}
P_x &= (R - r)cos(\alpha) + Dcos(\alpha\frac{R - r}{r}) \\
P_y &= (R - r)sin(\alpha) - Dsin(\alpha\frac{R - r}{r}) \\
\end{align}
$$

Remember that:

-   $P$ is the tracing point for the spirograph
-   $R$ is the radius of the fixed circle
-   $r$ is the radius of the movable circle
-   $\alpha$ is the rotation of the rotating wheel around the track
-   $D$ is the distance from the tracing point to the center of the rotating wheel

Notice that for an epitrochoid, the objective is still to find the tracing point $P$, and that $R$, $\alpha$, and $D$ will remain unchanged. So how can we tell an equation that we want the rotating wheel to be on the outside of the fixed gear?

Here's that old Desmos from last time. See if you can find out how to get the rotating gear on the outside of the fixed gear.
