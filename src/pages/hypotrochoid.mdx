# Chapter 1

## Round and Round Again

The first thing you might do when given a spirograph is revolving the little gear inside of the big gear (and trying not to cry when it slips out of place). Playing around, you might notice the variety of curves that can be produced:

It looks like changing the size of the fixed gear, the size of the rolling gear, and the position where the pen is placed changes its shape. So how can we describe this mathematically? The first step is to make some assumptions: we assume that the gears can be modeled as wheels with a specific circumference. The makers of the spirograph likely chose teeth to prevent slipping, but in our mathematical utopia, that is not a problem. Notice now we are describing a hypotrochoid, where the rolling circle is inside of the fixed circle.

In this diagram, let:

-   $P$ be the point where the pen is (the tracing point)
-   $F$ be the center of the fixed, outer circle with radius $R$
-   $M$ be the center of the moving circle with radius $r$
-   $D$ be the distance between the center of the circle $M$ and point $P$
-   $A$ be a fixed point on the fixed circle $F$
-   $B$ be a fixed point on the movable circle $M$
-   $C$ be the point of tangency between the fixed circle $F$ and movable circle $M$

Right, let's roll the movable circle inside the fixed circle an angle $\alpha$:

Notice how all of the points that have been moved now have a subscript of 1. Our goal now is to describe the position of point $P$ given an angle $\alpha$. To do this, we can use parametric equations! If point $F$ is at the origin, all we need to do is find coordinates of point $P$.

But for this we need some more information! Let's draw a line parallel to $\overline{FA}$ going through point $M$ and another through point $P$, and drop the heights from point $P$ and $M$.

Now, let

-   $T$ be the point where the dropped height from $M$ meets $\overline{FA}$
-   $S$ be the point where the dropped height from $P_1$ meets $\overline{FA}$
-   $U$ be the point where the the line parallel to $\overline{FA}$ from $P_1$ meets $\overline{MT}$
-   $\beta$ be the $\angle UMP_1$.

Notice how the x-coordinate of $P_1$ is equal to $\overline{FS}$, and the y-coordinate is equal to $SP_1$.

Since $UTSP_1$ makes a rectangle, then $PS = UT$ and $PU = ST$.
